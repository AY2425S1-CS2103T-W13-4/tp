--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Tags in Knotty Planners are used exclusively to tag person to wedding, hence both wedding name and tag names should be 2 person names separated with a & (e.g. `John Loh & Jean Tan`, `Stacy & Sam`).

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `John Loh & Jean Tan`, `Stacy & Sam` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Prefixes refer to the identifier before the parameter e.g. `n/` before `NAME`. Invalid prefixes (i.e. prefixes that do not exist) will be ignored.<br>
e.g. if the command specifies `tag-add n/John Doe b/juice t/John Loh & Jean Tan`, it will be interpreted as `tag-add n/John Doe t/John Loh & Jean Tan`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
  </box>

### Viewing Help: `help`

You can view a popup with an overview of all commands, and also a link to this user guide if you need more details.

![help message](images/helpmsg.png)


### Adding a Contact: `add`

You can add a person to the list of contacts.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS j/JOB [t/TAG]`

* A person can have any number of tags (including 0). Tags are associated to the weddings this person is
  involved in. Weddings must already exist in the wedding book to successfully tag a person to a wedding.
  
* To make adding a person easier, Knotty Planner will format their names for you! Person name will be automatically capitalised and separated with 1 space. Trailing spaces and extra space in between will be removed.
  
  Examples:`john doe`, `JOHN    doe` will all be formatted to `John Doe`

<box type="important" seamless>

**IMPORTANT:**

* If you are worried about adding duplicated people, fret not! Knotty Planner will alert you when an identical person is added
* We will also alert you when you add a different person with the same name, we need your help to change their input name in these situations üòä

  automatically format the name by removing the extra spacing and correctly capitalizing it ü§©

<box type="warning" seamless>

**<span style="color: red;">CAUTION:</span>**
  
* If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Knotty Planner will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

* Furthermore, certain edits can cause the Knotty Planner to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimise the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimised, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **List Command** ignores any extraneous parameters after the `list` command. This is a feature, not a bug.
4. **Filter Command** returns the largest range of matches based on your input. This is a feature, not a bug.
5. **Names and Wedding Names** are automatically formatted to have the first letter of each word capitalized. This is a feature, not a bug.
