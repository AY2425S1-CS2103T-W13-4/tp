# KnottyPlanners üíçüéÄ

KnottyPlanners is a **desktop app for wedding planners, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a wedding planner who can type fast, KnottyPlanners can make organising weddings a walk in the park!

### What is Command Line Interface? ü§î
Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to type text commands to perform specific tasks quickly and efficiently on a computer. Don't worry if you are still unsure about CLI, we will walk you through in this User Guide! üòä

### Why use Command Line Interface ? 
* **Efficiency:** Perform tasks faster by replacing multiple mouse clicks into a single line of text ‚úÖ
* **Precision:** Avoid mis-clicking and mistakes as CLI will execute the exact command you type üíØ
* **Offline:** CLI does not require internet and allows you to use it anywhere üë©‚Äçüíª

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

** Important notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* KnottyPlanners do not accept any empty parameters, hence, please add in a placeholder value that you choose to replace an empty input (e.g. `p/000` or `a/nil` ).

* Tags in KnottyPlanners are used exclusively to tag person to wedding, hence both wedding name and tag names should be 2 person names separated with a & (e.g. `John Loh & Jean Tan`, `Stacy & Sam`).

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `John Loh & Jean Tan`, `Stacy & Sam` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `list-wed`, `exit`, `clear-ab` and `clear-wb`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Prefixes refer to the identifier before the parameter e.g. `n/` before `NAME`. Invalid prefixes (i.e. prefixes that do not exist) will be ignored.<br>
e.g. if the command specifies `tag-add n/John Doe b/juice t/John Loh & Jean Tan`, it will be interpreted as `tag-add n/John Doe t/John Loh & Jean Tan`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
  </box>

### Viewing Help: `help`

You can view a popup with an overview of all commands, and also a link to this user guide if you need more details.

Format: `help`

![help message](images/helpmsg.png)


### Adding a Contact: `add`

You can add a person to the list of contacts.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS j/JOB [t/TAG]`

* A person can have any number of tags (including 0). Tags are associated to the weddings this person is
  involved in. Weddings must already exist in the wedding book to successfully tag a person to a wedding.

<box type="important" seamless>

**IMPORTANT:**

* If you are worried about adding duplicated people, fret not! KnottyPlanners will alert you when an identical person is added
* We will also alert you when you add a different person with the same name, you can add in keywords in these situations to differentiate them üòä (e.g. if `John` is duplicated, you can consider changing into `John Tan` or `John from school`)    

</box>

![add message](images/addMsg.png)

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, Blk 123, #01-04 j/Photographer`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe p/90341259 e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Center j/Caterer t/Stacy & Sam` P.S. The wedding `Stacy & Sam` must be created first using `add-wed` command!

### Deleting a Contact: `del` followed by `y` or `n`

You can delete a person from your list of contacts.

Format: `del n/NAME` followed by `y` or `n`

* Deletes the person with the specified `NAME` from the address book.
* The contact's details are shown for confirmation.
* The contact is deleted if `y` is entered.
* The contact is not deleted if `n` is entered, cancelling the delete operation and nothing will occur.

<box type="important" seamless>

**IMPORTANT:** 
* `del n/NAME` MUST BE followed by either of the two commands, otherwise, following delete commands may be affected.
* If you accidentally mistype or enter an unintended command before confirming, we suggest you to use `n` to cancel any pending delete operations to ensure everything runs smoothly üòä

You can edit an existing contact's details (name, phone number, email, address and job).

Format: `edit n/NAME [new/NEW_NAME] [p/NEW_PHONE] [e/NEW_EMAIL] [a/NEW_ADDRESS] [j/NEW_JOB]`

* You have to provide at least one of the optional fields.
* If you accidentally type the name of the contact in all capitals or add one too many spaces, don't worry! KnottyPlanners will
  automatically format the name by removing the extra spacing and correctly capitalizing it ü§©

<box type="important" seamless>

**IMPORTANT:** 
* Tags can't be edited, so if you'd like to change a tag, simply delete the existing one using
['tag-del'](#deleting-tags-from-a-contact) and add a new one using ['tag-add'](#adding-tags-to-a-contact)!
* Multiple input of the same parameter can be added but only the last one will be accepted (e.g. `edit n/John p/111 p/222` will edit phone number to `222`)
* If you edit a person with the same parameters, we will not alert you

* To make adding a wedding easier, Knotty Planner will format the names for you! Wedding names will be automatically capitalised and separated with 1 space. Trailing spaces and extra space in between will be removed.
  Examples: `john & jane`, `JOHN   & jane` will all be formatted to `John & Jane`.

* The wedding is deleted if `y` is entered.
* The wedding is not deleted if `n` is entered, cancelling the delete operation and nothing will occur.

Format: `del-wed w/NAME & NAME` / `dw w/NAME & NAME` followed by `y` or `n`

<box type="important" seamless>

**IMPORTANT:** 

* `dw w/NAME & NAME` MUST BE followed by either of the two commands, otherwise, following delete commands may be affected.
* If you accidentally mistype or enter an unintended command before confirming, we suggest you to use `n` to cancel any pending delete operations to ensure everything runs smoothly üòä
* The wedding must be entered exactly as it was saved in the wedding book to successfully delete it.
* As we do not have an edit wedding command, please use ['del-wed'](#deleting-a-wedding-del-wed--dw) and ['add-wed'](#adding-a-wedding-add-wed--aw) to change details of a wedding

* Only full words will be matched e.g. `jak` will not match `Jake`, `sam` will not match `Sam Tan`.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimise the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimised, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Edit commands** can have multiple inputs of the same parameter but only the last input will be accepted (e.g. `edit n/John p/111 p/222` the edited phone number will become `222`)
